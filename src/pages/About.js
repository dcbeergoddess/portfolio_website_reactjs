        <h1>Rachel Michel Murray</h1>
        <h3> Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
        <br></br>

        <p>I was born in Missoula, Montana. I spent my elementary school
        years living in Scottsdale, Arizona and my High School time in Kansas City, Missouri before ending up in Washington, DC for my undergrad at Georgetown University and have been here ever since.</p>
        <p>During my time at Georgetown I was an integral part of a student activist campaign, lead by the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, that successfully organized to make Georgetown guarantee all workers a Living Wage. As a student, I also ended up getting a job waiting tables at The Brickskeller, which at the beginning of the American Craft Beer Revolution, held the Guinness Book of World Records for their large beer selection from around the world. This launched my career in the Hospitality Industry with a focus on American Craft Beer and Spirits.</p>
        <p>After 15 years working in the restaurant industry as a bartender, manager, social media director and more, I took a sabbatical and started looking for what is next for my career. Over the past 10 years I have spent some time dabbling in the tech world via menu design, social media marketing and film editing. As a graduate from The George Washington University Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, I am now armed with the skills to become a successful web developer and look forward to any future collaborations or projects that comes my way! </p>

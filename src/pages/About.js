        <h2>Rachel Michel Murray</h2>
        <h3> Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
        <br></br>

        <p>Born in Missoula, Montana, I spent my elementary school years living in Scottsdale, Arizona, my High School time in Kansas City, Missouri and ended up in Washington, DC as an undergrad at Georgetown University and never left!</p>
        <p> I am a creative and passionate Full Stack Web Developer bringing over a decade of experience in hospitality management, marketing, and customer service armed with a Full-Stack Certification from The George Washington University. Before deciding to pursue a career in technology, I spent 15 years working in the restaurant industry as a bartender, manager, social media director and more. I was an early influencer in the Craft Beer Industry both locally and beyond driven by a dedication to share my knowledge and passion for the growing scene. I am an excellent communicator with strong interpersonal skills and, through my management positions, I developed strong leadership skills when it comes to guiding a team in a fast-paced, high-stress environment.</p>
        <p>During the intensive GW coding bootcamp, I gained experience in the foundations of web development learning tech skills ranging from HTML/CSS to React.js and honed my leadership abilities in a project setting to become a successful Team Leader while working and learning remotely. I am looking to bring my passion and skills to an innovative company that is dedicated to community and collaboration to further my growth in the tech industry and become a valuable asset. </p>
